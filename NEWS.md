* Bugfix in testing linked parameters
* Added sets containing zero (e.g. PosReals$new(zero = TRUE)) to the support dictionary

* Now support parameters being required and linked simultaneously. Exactly one parameter in a required/linked group must be set.
* Added 'immutable' property for parameters that can be set on construction then cannot be changed
* Renamed 'ExtendedReals' to 'ExtReals'
